## Project Overview

My web shop application includes all the necessary features for customers to buy books. Users can easily read book descriptions, add or remove books from their basket, proceed to the order panel, and either create a new user account or log in to an existing one. Users then fill in all the required fields and choose from various options before submitting the order.

Upon completion, users can navigate to their user panel, where they have the ability to change their account name and view all their previous orders. Additionally, they can log out, delete their account, or return to the sales window.

To check and use all functions, you need to install the server side, which you can download and install from the following link:

This application aims to provide a seamless experience for customers, allowing them to manage their accounts, place orders, and explore book offerings effortlessly.

Feel free to explore the responsive design by checking the site on various devices, such as phones, to experience the optimized views for different screens.

In a nutshell: all essential steps and functions in a web shop.
